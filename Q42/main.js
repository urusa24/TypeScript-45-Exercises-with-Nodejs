//===================================================================================================
//.	Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called 
//make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s 
//name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
//Define a function to print each magician name from an array
function show_magicians(magician) {
    magician.forEach(function (name) { return console.log(name); });
}
//Function to make magicians great through .map it will modify array
function make_great(magician) {
    return magician.map(function (name) { return "The Great ".concat(name); });
}
//Define an array containing magicians name
var magician_name = ["Harry poter", "Talha", "Hamzah"];
//Call the function to print each magicians name
show_magicians(magician_name);
//Call make_great function to modify magicians name
var great_magician = make_great(magician_name);
//Call show magicians that show modified list of magicians
show_magicians(great_magician);
